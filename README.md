## **About the Project**

**Orrery** is a web application that simulates the distances, speeds, and sizes of all the celestial bodies in the Solar System. This project visually represents planets, moons, and other celestial objects, allowing users to explore the vastness of our Solar System and better understand the relative scales between them. The application uses SCSS, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript for a dynamic, interactive, and responsive experience.

You can view the live demo here: [Orrery Web App](https://krishujeniya.github.io/Orrery/)

### **Key Features**

- **Dynamic Planetary Simulation**: Displays planets and their orbital paths in real-time.
- **Distance and Size Comparison**: Visualizes the distances and sizes of the planets in the Solar System.
- **Speed Calculation**: Displays the relative speeds at which celestial bodies move through space.
- **Interactive Interface**: Navigate through the Solar System and explore details of different planets.
- **Responsive Design**: Built using SCSS and CSS, ensuring the web app works across devices and screen sizes.

## **Technologies Used**

- **SCSS**: Used for enhanced styling and better manageability of CSS.
- **CSS**: Provides the visual style and responsive layout for the project.
- **HTML**: Forms the structure of the web application.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactive elements to the Orrery simulation.
